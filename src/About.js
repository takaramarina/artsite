      <p>This is not really about the artist. <br/><br/>

        This is not about who made what.<br/><br/>

        This is really about how this perspective is materialized.<br/><br/>

        There are levels to the belief in material. <br/><br/>

        The more you are in charge of your actions, the more you convey deeper intention. <br/><br/>

        The more you see intention in your language, the more you believe in the world. <br/><br/>

        More you can do. Infinite mental. True Human Resources. <br/><br/>

        I would define all artworks as the physical language.</p>
